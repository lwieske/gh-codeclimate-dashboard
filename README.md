## Welcome to GitHub/Codeclimate Integration

[Codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) integrates [GitHub](https://github.com) without any changes to code repositories. You just import the repositories on the Code Climate home page. You may follow well known open source projects as well as your own projects. Current support includes Ruby on Rails and Javascript; other languages are under preparation.

## The rails/ruby/vagrant Examples

The following badges are linked to the corresponding analysis on the codeclimate page and give you a first impression of the information delivered.
